# MFRC522 RFID Read & Write

## Pin layout

These are the pins used when connecting the Raspberry Pi and the MFRC522 RFID together.

|Raspberry Pi     | RFID     |

| Pin 22          |  RST     |
| Pin 6           |  GND     |
| Pin 21          |  MISO    |
| Pin 19          |  MOSI    |

## Items and Technologies used for built

The Items I used to build this project was a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, some Jumper wires, a MFRC522 RFID Read & Write, breadboard, and some RFID Cards & Tags.

The technologies I will use are Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. More technologies might be added but these are for certain.

What if we use google spreadsheet API to store user name, time stamp, etc. Remember to include buzzer to let user know if attendance have recorded.

I will also plan to use Solidworks CAD design to build an outer frame to house the Raspberry Pi, RFID reader and all other componets into a 3D printed case.
