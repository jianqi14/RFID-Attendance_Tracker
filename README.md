# MFRC522 RFID Read & Write

## Pin layout

These are the pins used when connecting the Raspberry Pi and the MFRC522 RFID together.

|Raspberry Pi     | RFID     |
|-----------------|----------|
| Pin 1           |  3.3v    |
| Pin 22          |  RST     |
| Pin 6           |  GND     |
| Pin 21          |  MISO    |
| Pin 19          |  MOSI    |
| Pin 23          |  SCK     |
| Pin 24          |  SDA     |

|Buzzer	| input	| outPut|

## Items and Technologies used for built

The Items I used to build this project was a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, some Jumper wires, a MFRC522 RFID Read & Write, breadboard, and some RFID Cards & Tags.

The technologies I will use are Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. More technologies might be added but these are for certain.

There is also a Buzzer noise for confirmation to let the user know when the RFID had processed a task. The Pin that the Buzzer will occupied on Raspberry pi board is Pin 12.

What if we use google spreadsheet API to store user name, time stamp, etc.

I will also plan to use Solidworks CAD design to build an outer frame to house the Raspberry Pi, RFID reader and all other componets into a 3D printed case.
